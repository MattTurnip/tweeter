# Quacker

Quacker is a very basic, single-page clone of the popular website "Twitter". Users click the compose button, and are treated with a wondrous jQuery animation that reveals are box with which they can voice their opinions, moods, news and etc... 

Currently, Quacker does not implement unique users, so instead it attaches a randomly generated username, handle and avatar for each "Tweet". The good news is that the tweets are stored in a database. Your 'Tweets' are durable and they will stand the ravages of time.
